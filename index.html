                    <li>Born on August 8, 1879, Anenecuilco, Mexico to Mestizo peasants with Nahua ancestry.</li>
                    <li>Orphaned at the young age of 17, Zapata had always been a revolutionary.</li>
                    <li>He was arrested in 1897 for protesting the hacienda that appropirated his village's land.</li>
                    <li>In 1909, due to his leadership skills, he was elected as his village's council board president.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Always a man of the people, Zapata involved himself with the struggles of the local peasant farmers.</li>
                    <li>Zapata constantly fought against encroaching landowners who stole village land for their own greed.</li>
                    <li>Zapata always used peaceful means to get village land back, but with the growing wealth of haciendas and the indifference of the Mexican government, Zapata found that the only option was force.</li>
                    <li>When the Mexican Revolution began in 1910, Zapata found himself aligning with Franchiso Madero who promised land reform if they were able to overthrow Porfirio Díaz.</li>

                    <li>In 1910, Zapata became the general of the Ejército Libertador del Sur or the Liberation Army of the South.</li>
                    <li>After capturing Cuautla in May 1911, Zapata's victory along side the victories of Pancho Villa and Pascual Orozco forced Díaz to flee to Europe.</li>
                    <li>Francisco Madero then took the presidency but renegated on his promise to Zapata. Their relationship soured and Zapata adopted the Plan of Ayala. </li>
                    <li>In 1913, General Victoriano Huerta assassinated Francisco Madero. He attempted to gain Zapata's support against Venustiano Carranza and Pancho Villa to the North.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>As Huerta's position deteriated, he resigned and fled Mexico, leaving the remaining factions in Mexico to fill the power vacuum.</li>
                    <li>It was during the Convention of Aguascalientes that Villa's and Carranza's break became obvious. Villa then created a loose alliance with Zapata and took over Mexico City.</li>
                    <li>However, Zapata returned to the South and his home state of Morelos. This would be the beginning of the end for the revolutionaries as Carranza slowly grew back into power and defeated Pancho Villa in the North.</li>
                    <li>On April 10 1919, agents of Carranza assassinated Zapata, with Col. Jesus Guajardo feigning that he wanted to defect to Zapata's side.</li>
